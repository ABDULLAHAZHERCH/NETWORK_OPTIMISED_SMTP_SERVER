# ** Network Optimized SMTP Server**  

### **Introduction**  
This project implements a custom SMTP server tailored for optimal email handling and communication. By enhancing the standard SMTP protocol, the server delivers additional functionality such as secure transmission, error management, and email filtering. It aims to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical use cases in networking and programming.

### **Key Features**  
- **Connection Establishment**: Secure connections with clients and servers.  
- **Email Creation and Transmission**: Compose, attach files, and send emails securely.  
- **Content Verification**: Validate email content for format and integrity.  
- **Directory Management**: Organize emails into appropriate directories.  
- **Error Handling**: Provide feedback for errors in real-time.  
- **Security Enhancements**: TLS/SSL encryption and authentication mechanisms.  
- **Advanced Features**: Email queuing, spam filtering, multi-threading, and logging.  

### **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: 
  - `smtplib`, `socket` for SMTP and networking.  
  - File handling libraries.  
  - OpenSSL for encryption.  
- **Platform**: Localhost (with potential cloud deployment).  

### **System Architecture**  
- **Client-Server Model**: 
  - Sender: Composes and sends emails.  
  - Server: Processes, stores, and forwards emails.  
  - Receiver: Receives and stores emails.  

### **Development Phases**  
1. Research and Initial Setup  
2. Email Handling and Attachments  
3. Directory and File Management  
4. Error Handling and Security Enhancements  
5. Testing and Debugging  

### **Enhancements**  
Future improvements include:  
- GUI for email management.  
- Mobile app for accessibility.  
- Database integration for scalability.  

### **Benefits**  
- Practical insights into networking protocols.  
- Hands-on experience with secure client-server communication.  
- Potential for real-world applications and advanced projects.  

### **Usage**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Network_Optimized_SMTP_Server.git
   ```  
2. Navigate to the project directory and set up dependencies.  
3. Run the server and start sending emails securely!
